# Game Phases Overview

This section describes all the game phases in Rosiko, from initial setup to gameplay. Each phase has specific mechanics and validation rules.

## Phase Flow

The game progresses through several phases in order:

1. **Territory Assignment** - Initial distribution of territories among players
2. **Color Selection** - Players choose their army colors in sequence
3. **Troops Assignment** - Calculate and assign initial troops based on player count
4. **Objectives Assignment** - Secret assignment of main and secondary objectives

## Implementation Details

Each phase is managed by the **GameManager** and follows a server-authoritative architecture:

- **Server Validation** - All phase transitions are validated on the server
- **Deterministic Logic** - Same seed produces same results across all clients
- **Replication** - State changes are automatically replicated to clients
- **Turn-based Flow** - Players act in sequence based on turn order

For more information on the overall game flow, see the [Game Flow](/docs/overview/game_flow) documentation.
